# See.Know.Bias

An app for detecting bias in news media, designed to develop media literacy in todayâ€™s youth. Built on a dataset of Wikipedia neutral point-of-view edits, See.Know.Bias uses NLP modelling techniques to automatically identify biased sentences in news articles and highlight the most biased words.

This app was built together with [Nicholas Broad](https://github.com/nbroad1881) and [Edward Johnson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwardjohnson/), as our capstone for [aggregate intellect](https://ai.science)'s Modern Natural Language Processing workshop.
