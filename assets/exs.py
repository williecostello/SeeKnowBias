nyt = '''A resounding primary win by Democratic U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and a fellow liberal's lead over a longtime New York congressman signaled fresh momentum for progressive politics amid growing calls for economic and racial justice in the United States.

Tuesday's nominating contests in New York, Kentucky and several other states pitted establishment Democrats against challengers pushing for sweeping change after the May 25 death of George Floyd, a Black man, while in Minneapolis police custody.

Early election results showed Black and other minority candidates putting up strong performances in several contests.

"It may be that the recent focus on Black Lives Matter and racial inequities in policing opened Democratic voters’ eyes even more to Black candidates," said Kyle Kondik, an elections analyst at the University of Virginia.

Jamaal Bowman, a Black middle-school principal backed by Ocasio-Cortez and other leading progressives, looked poised to defeat U.S. Representative Eliot Engel, the chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee who has been in Congress more than three decades. Bowman led by about 60% to 34%.

Whoever wins the Democratic nomination is likely to win the seat encompassing parts of the Bronx and Westchester County in November.

"I’m a Black man raised by a single mother in a housing project. That story doesn’t usually end in Congress," Bowman tweeted on Wednesday as he declared victory. "But today, that 11-year-old boy beaten by police is about to be your Representative. I can't wait to get to DC and cause problems for those maintaining the status quo."

Engel did not concede, however, with a record number of requested absentee ballots because of the coronavirus pandemic not yet counted.

"Any declarative statement on the outcome of this race right now is premature and undermines the democratic process," his campaign said in a statement.

In a neighboring district, Ocasio-Cortez secured about 70% of the vote against centrist challenger Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, who got less than 20%, New York state election results showed.

"We are proving that the people’s movement in NY isn’t an accident," Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. "It's a mandate."

She is expected to win a second term in the November general election in her heavily Democratic New York City district.

Hundreds of thousands of absentee ballots were also outstanding in Kentucky, where Black progressive state legislator Charles Booker was locked in a battle with former fighter pilot Amy McGrath to become the Democratic candidate to face Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Nov. 3.

Like Engel, McGrath, a prolific fundraiser, was backed by the Democratic Party establishment. She had the edge over Booker in early results, but those did not include the state's two most populous counties and many absentee ballots. Complete results will not be known before June 30, Kentucky officials said.

Another Black candidate, physician Cameron Webb, beat three white opponents in the primary for a U.S. House seat representing central Virginia that Democrats hope to snatch from Republicans.

Also in New York, Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney was slightly ahead of liberal challenger Suraj Patel. Two gay Black candidates, Mondaire Jones and Ritchie Torres, were leading in races to replace retiring Representatives Nita Lowey and Jose Serrano, respectively.

President Donald Trump's endorsed candidate, Lynda Bennett, lost to 24-year-old Madison Cawthorn in a Republican congressional primary in North Carolina, while a maverick Republican whom Trump had harshly criticized, Representative Thomas Massie, claimed victory in his Kentucky race.'''

foxnews = '''Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., took an online victory lap Tuesday night after she handily won the Democratic primary in her Bronx and Queens congressional district, saying her win proves that the far-left movement she leads in New York and nationally is "a mandate."

Ocasio-Cortez surprised political observers when she upset the powerful New York Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley, who at the time was the chair of the House Democratic Caucus, in a 2018 primary. Her far-left campaign promises and embrace of democratic socialism excited the base in her district and launched her into national stardom once she was in Congress.

"When I won in 2018, many dismissed our victory as a 'fluke,'" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Tuesday after it became clear she would win the primary. "Our win was treated as an aberration, or bc my opponent 'didn’t try.' So from the start, tonight’s race was important to me. Tonight we are proving that the people’s movement in NY isn’t an accident. It‘s a mandate."

With 100 percent of results in, the congresswoman running her first reelection campaign took 70 percent of the primary vote. Her moderate U.S. Chamber of Commerce-backed opponent, former CNBC contributor Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, managed only 19 percent. Ocasio-Cortez, a member of "the Squad" of four freshman Democratic House members who aim to push the party to the left, declared victory over the "Wall Street CEOs" she regularly rails against.

"Wall Street CEOs, from Goldman Sachs to Blackstone, poured in millions to defeat our grassroots campaign tonight. But their money couldn’t buy a movement," she said. "Here’s to speaking truth to power."

Republicans have dismissed Ocasio-Cortez's ideas, like the "Green New Deal," as unrealistic and dangerous for the country.

Self-declared democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., spoke highly of the 30-year-old lawmaker after her primary win.

"The people in her district have spoken loudly and clearly about her leadership, her struggles for workers's (sic) rights, racial justice, climate change and many other issues," he said. "Taking on a well-funded opponent, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez won a landslide victory. Congratulations Alexandria."

And Ocasio-Cortez wasn't the only far-left Democrat in New York City to have a great primary night. Middle school principal Jamaal Bowman, with the majority of the results in, holds a significant lead over longtime Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y. If his lead holds, the Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders-endorsed Bowman would pull off an upset on nearly the same level as Ocasio-Cortez's victory over Crowley.'''

post = '''Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez looks set to waltz to a second term as the self-described Democratic socialist dominated her primary competition Tuesday night.

The incumbent — almost better known by her initials, AOC, than her actual name — rolled to victory, claiming 73 percent of the ballots cast at the polls during early voting and on primary day, with 74 percent of precincts reporting.

Her best-funded opponent — Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, a former Republican and financial news reporter — had nabbed just 20 percent of the vote.

“When I won in 2018, many dismissed our victory as a ‘fluke,'” AOC tweeted as the vote counts rolled in. “Our [2016] win was treated as an aberration, or bc my opponent ‘didn’t try.'”

“So from the start, tonight’s race was important to me,” she added. “Tonight we are proving that the people’s movement in NY isn’t an accident. It‘s a mandate.”

Ocasio-Cortez was expected to easily win the race, in which Caruso-Cabrera focused on the incumbent’s opposition to the Amazon headquarters deal for Long Island City, as well as her far-left leanings as a leader of the congressional progressives, and brought renewed attention to complaints she hasn’t focused enough on constituent services.

But her last-minute attack ads on Caruso-Cabrera gave some poll watchers reason to think she was vulnerable.

Caruso-Cabrera put out a statement late Tuesday that did not congratulate Ocasio-Cortez and instead thanked her husband and supporters.

AOC’s heavily Democratic district covers portions of western Queens, including Astoria and Elmhurst, and the eastern portion of The Bronx.

She faces a Republican challenger, John Cummings, in the fall, who told The Post in a statement that he is “looking forward to putting my lifetime record of service in the district up against Rep. Ocasio-Cortez’s superficial socialist social media stardom.”'''

breitbart = '''Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), known as “AOC,” openly cheered reports of teenagers and Korean pop music fans using the Chinese-owned app TikTok to sign up for President Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and inflate RSVP numbers.

TikTok, which is popular among teenagers around the world, is considered such a security threat by the U.S. military that soldiers and sailors are banned from using it on government-issued phones. In October, Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) asked the U.S. intelligence community to investigate the app.

The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) also published a report on Wednesday that suggested that TikTok was boosting the views of certain videos where users flattered Chinese President and Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping.

Nonetheless, Ocasio-Cortez bragged on Twitter Saturday night that “teens” and “KPop allies” used the app to purposely inflate Trump’s rally RSVPs. “KPop” is a reference to South Korean pop music. It is not clear who these alleged music fans or “allies” are.

TikTok is owned by Beijing-based company Bytedance Ltd. National security laws passed in recent years in China allow for the Communist-controlled authoritarian government to access any data that Chinese companies obtain.

WSJ reported that Cotton and Schumer were concerned that the Chinese government was censoring content, and media reports have alleged that the app was removing videos that were “politically sensitive” in China.

Two people interviewed by the WSJ claimed that videos where they praised Xi had an uptick in views.

One, a 23-year-old Texas songwriter named TJ Asaday, said his account skyrocketed from 2,000 fans to over 90,000 after he made a 13-second video in April calling Xi “my president.”

“I’d never seen any type of growth on my page until I made that joking video,” he said.

On Sunday, CNN interviewed a grandmother named Mary Jo Laupp who claimed that she started the campaign for fake RSVPs on TikTok witjh a video late Thursday night, and it was viral by Friday morning. She is a former Pete Buttigieg campaign volunteer.'''

jacobin = '''After a rollercoaster few months, first with Bernie Sanders dropping out and then with the unprecedented explosion of protest in response to the police murder of George Floyd, there can be little doubt that last night’s elections in New York and Kentucky were a cause for celebration for the Left.

Though results are still coming in, insurgent candidates — many backed by Justice Democrats, the Working Families Party, and the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) — clearly had a good night. The liberal status quo had a very bad one.

The undisputed highlight is New York’s Sixteenth Congressional District, where middle school principal Jamaal Bowman successfully ousted Representative Eliot Engel — the most senior Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and unquestionably one of the worst Democrats in Congress — by a double-digit margin.

Bowman earned endorsements from Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC); Engel was the party establishment’s favorite, counting Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and even the Congressional Black Caucus among his endorsers. Engel, a member of the House since 1989 who supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq, hadn’t faced a competitive primary in twenty years.

AOC herself, meanwhile, put to rest the idea, faddish in some liberal circles, that her 2018 victory over Joe Crowley was an electoral fluke. Challenged by Wall Street-backed CNBC anchor Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, who openly opposes progressive measures like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, Ocasio-Cortez won easily, improving on her result against Crowley and taking home more than 70 percent of the vote.

In New York state and local primaries, DSA activist Jabari Brisport looks set to oust Tremaine Wright and join fellow DSA-er Julia Salazar in the state senate, while the DSA’s Zohran Mamdani ended the night with a comfortable lead in his race for the state assembly. Thirty-three-year old Mondaire Jones, backed by Sanders, AOC, and the Working Families Party maintains a lead in his NY-17 House primary. DSA-ers Marcela Mitaynes and Phara Souffrant Forrest did not win, but both ended the night with strong showings in local races.

Though the outcome of Kentucky’s Democratic Senate primary won’t be known until mail-in ballots are counted at the end of the month, Charles Booker also looks to be nipping at the heels of pro-Trump Democrat Amy McGrath. If successful, he will face Republican Senate Majority Leader and right-wing supervillain Mitch McConnell in the fall. Also in Kentucky, at the local level in Louisville, DSA member Robert Lavertis Bell was up for city council, though the results of his race won’t be in for several weeks.

The sudden collapse of the Sanders campaign following the euphoric months of January and February inevitably precipitated ominous discussions about the Left’s prospects and its hopes for continued gains in electoral politics, with focus on primaries and caucuses that characterized the start of the year quickly, giving way to protests and street level organizing.

Last night’s races refreshingly suggest that plenty of incumbent Democrats remain vulnerable to challenges from left insurgents — and that, despite Sanders’s defeat, the appetite for a transformative agenda that includes a Green New Deal, ambitious criminal justice reform, and Medicare For All hasn’t gone away.'''



# https://www.newsweek.com/aoc-sweeps-ny-primary-says-win-shows-2018-upset-victory-wasnt-fluke-1513061

newsweek = '''Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez sailed through her first primary challenge since being elected two years ago, all but securing her a second term in Congress.

As of Wednesday morning, Ocasio-Cortez was in the lead with 73 percent of the vote. Her opponent Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, a longtime news anchor and former Republican, had garnered 19 percent of the vote in New York's 14th Congressional District. Although the final numbers from Tuesday's primary won't be known for several days, given the large number of absentee ballots used by voters to maintain public health amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Associated Press and other outlets called the race for Ocasio-Cortez late Tuesday night.

Ocasio-Cortez celebrated the victory as proof her shocking 2018 upset win against 10-term incumbent Joe Crowley — which catapulted her into the national spotlight as the youngest woman ever elected to Congress — was no "fluke."

"Tonight we are proving that the people's movement in NY isn't an accident. It's a mandate," she wrote.

Despite polling that showed Ocasio-Cortez in good standing with her constituents — surveys conducted by her campaign last month found that 79 percent of likely Democratic voters had a favorable view of her — she spent heavily throughout the primary. She shelled out $6 million on the race after raising more than $10.5 million. By comparison, Caruso-Cabrera spent nearly $1 million and raised about $2 million.

The two traded jabs along the campaign trail. Caruso-Cabrera tried to attack Ocasio-Cortez as a creature of Washington who was out of step with her community. She also criticized the 30-year-old congresswoman for her progressive policies, which she said made her a "divisive" and "polarizing" figure within the Democratic Party.

Ocasio-Cortez and her team portrayed Caruso-Cabrera as a candidate backed by corporate interests, highlighting reports that Wall Street executives and pro-Trump donors were funding her campaign. In several ads that aired just before Election Day, Ocasio-Cortez also criticized her opponent for once being a registered Republican and for living at Trump Tower in Manhattan before moving to the 14th District last year.

"Wall Street CEOs, from Goldman Sachs to Blackstone, poured in millions to defeat our grassroots campaign tonight. But their money couldn't buy a movement," Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on Tuesday.

Ocasio-Cortez will face Republican challenger John Cummings in November, a retired New York Police Department officer. But the freshman Democrat is the heavy favorite heading into the general election. New York's 14th Congressional District, which includes portions of Queens and the Bronx, is reliably blue.

Newsweek reached out to the campaigns of Ocasio-Cortez and Caruso-Cabrera but did not receive a response before publication.'''
